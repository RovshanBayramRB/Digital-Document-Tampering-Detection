In this project, I have used MIDV-2020 dataset which is the combination of IDs and Passports of 10 different countries. The dataset contains 1000 images in total and JSON files having coordinates of attributes (name, surname, date, etc.). In the first most part of the project, I generated a Python script and used the JSON for annotating images to contain forgeries. After annotating all the images in the correct order, I developed a complex CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model as a task of Object Segmentation to detect tampered areas in the documents.
